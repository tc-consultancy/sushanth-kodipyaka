AboutAbout
I’m a Software Engineer and Full Stack Developer with 4+ years of experience building enterprise-grade, scalable, and secure applications across finance, healthcare, and technology.

For me, software development has never been just about writing code — it’s about solving real problems, building trust with stakeholders, and delivering systems that make a measurable impact. I take complete ownership of the solutions I build, from design to deployment, ensuring they’re not only functional but also drive meaningful business outcomes.

My journey started with a curiosity about how businesses operate, and I quickly realized that technology is the thread connecting every process. That curiosity grew into a passion for creating solutions that are as efficient as they are impactful — whether it’s designing secure microservices in Spring Boot, optimizing complex SQL queries, or building seamless UI experiences with Angular and React.

Along the way, I’ve deployed cloud-native systems on AWS and Azure, automated pipelines with Jenkins and GitLab, and built resilient microservices that power financial and healthcare systems used by thousands. I thrive on challenges that require discipline, persistence, and bold decision-making, and I believe that progress comes from never settling for “good enough.”

Today, I bring that same energy into solving complex, large-scale engineering challenges — combining strong foundations in data structures, algorithms, and system design with hands-on expertise in Java, Angular, React, Spring Boot, and cloud technologies. For me, this isn’t just a career — it’s a commitment to continuous learning, innovation, and driving impact through technology.
